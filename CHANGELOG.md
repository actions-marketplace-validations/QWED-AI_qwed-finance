## [3.0.0] - 2026-09-27

### Changed

- **BREAKING (npm `@qwed-ai/finance`):** SDK bridge scripts now transport
  JSON payloads through the child process's stdin with runtime boundary
  validation. Hostile or malformed inputs — strings in numeric positions,
  quote-carrying country codes, oversized payloads, mistyped token shapes —
  are rejected instead of resolving to defaults (CVSS 9.8 / 9.0, #79).

### Added

- `VerificationReceipt.get_signature(key)`: HMAC-SHA256 over the full canonical
  receipt — all 15 fields, sorted compact JSON, verifier-held key with no
  default (#44, #89).
- ISO currency and amount business limits wired into receipts (#65, #67).
- `RELEASE.md` release checklist covering version sync across Python, npm,
  uv.lock, README, and the GitHub Action pin.

### Fixed

- Fail-closed AML: canonical country codes, declared amount constraints
  enforced, malformed amounts rejected (#80, #82).
- Fail-closed sanctions: full party-field screening across multi-line values,
  shared normalized matcher, parsed UCP extraction (#81, #83).
- Fail-closed amounts: ambiguous or missing ISO amounts, unevaluable UCP
  payment amounts, empty/zero-deviation Sortino (#84, #85, #86).
- Fail-closed XML/MT/ISO message validation batch (#87).

### Testing

- 412 tests, including HMAC signature known-answer vectors and adversarial
  receipt mutation coverage.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-02

### Changed

- Security Audit Hardening: fail-closed enforcement in the OpenResponses
  integration, unified AML high-risk country list across all paths, rate
  parsing heuristic removed (fail-closed, returns Decimal), and the
  Float → Decimal/mpmath migration for BondGuard, DerivativesGuard, and
  RiskGuard (#22, #23).
- 150 tests at release, including float-contamination and N-04 regression
  coverage.
